# HearO — Frontend spec

Design system, screen specs, and implementation notes for the mobile app.

> For product framing, persona, brand reading, scope, and assets needed, see [README.md](./README.md).

## Design language

### Palette

Two surfaces. Most of the app is a **warm light** theme (sand/paper). The Session screen is an intentional exception — it stays an **immersive dark** moment so the scene imagery reads as evening and the voice captions stay legible over it.

**App surface — warm light (Welcome, Permissions, Setup, Home, After, crisis sheet):**

```
bg          #F2EBDD    warm sand/paper — primary surface
bg-elev     #E8DECB    cards, sheets
text        #2E2823    warm near-black — primary text
text-mute   #7A7060    secondary text
accent      #C17A45    terracotta — actions, focus
accent-soft #9A6238    same hue, darker — granted/disabled states
sage        #7E9468    grounding secondary (nature/calm)
critical    #BC6A4F    muted clay — crisis sheet only
```

**Scene surface — immersive dark (Session screen only):**

```
scene-text        #F4EEE3    primary text over scene imagery
scene-text-mute   #CDBBA6    secondary text / breathing ring
scene-accent      #E0A56B    brighter amber — pulse, slider, flash
sceneOverlayBottom #140F0C   dark anchor at the bottom of scene overlays
```

**Why warm light, not dark.** Research on trauma-informed and mental-health UI consistently flags two things: near-black / gray-heavy palettes correlate with depressive affect, and red is *activating* for trauma survivors. So we moved off the near-black base entirely, softened the accent away from red-orange toward terracotta, replaced the alarming pure-red `critical` with a muted clay, and added sage — a calming cool note that keeps the all-warm palette from feeling one-dimensional. Warm earth tones (sand, stone, clay) read as "linen, candlelight" rather than "digital."

**Why the Session screen stays dark.** It's the one immersive moment — an evening walk. The scene photo needs a dark overlay for the serif captions to be legible, and a bright photo-wash would kill the evening mood. So the session keeps its own light-on-dark `scene-*` palette while every other screen is light. This is a deliberate split, the same pattern as a photo viewer inside a light app.

### Scene backgrounds

Session screens are *cinematic with restraint*: a scene image (river, park, cafe, road) sits behind the foreground, covered by a warm-dark gradient overlay strong enough that the imagery reads as mood, not as a photograph. The voice and breathing circle stay quiet on top.

```
Image (cover)
└── LinearGradient (top → middle → bottom)
    top      rgba(36, 27, 22, ~0.82)
    middle   rgba(36, 27, 22, ~0.78)
    bottom   rgba(26, 19, 16, ~0.86)   anchored toward sceneOverlayBottom

During an auto-soften phase, overlay intensity bumps by ~0.08
to match the quieter foreground state.
```

Scenes available as `SceneKey`: `river`, `park`, `cafe`, `road`. Each has a scene-tint gradient (the color hint behind the imagery — green for park, cool teal for river, amber for cafe, dusty tan for road) so even if the network image fails to load, the screen still reads as the right *place*.

The Welcome, Permissions, Setup, Home, and After screens use the flat light `bg`, not scene imagery. Only the Session screen is cinematic — the others are notebook pages.

### Type

```
Display    Frank Ruhl Libre, 28/36
           used for the voice's spoken lines, headings,
           and any moment that should carry weight.
           Free on Google Fonts. Renders beautifully in Hebrew.

Body       Heebo, 17/24
           humanist sans, designed as the Hebrew counterpart
           to Roboto. Pairs naturally with Frank Ruhl Libre.
           Free on Google Fonts.
```

Single family pair across both languages. No serif/sans split between EN and HE — that would break visual coherence.

### Motion

```
default      600ms ease-out
scene xfade  4–7s between session phases
trigger      barely perceptible — single 200ms accent flash
             on the breathing circle. deliberately undramatic.
breathing    4s in, 6s out (slow exhale longer than inhale)
```

## Screen flow

Six screens in the demo path. Settings/profile is post-demo polish.

```
1. Welcome           single sentence + start
2. Permissions       HealthKit + notifications, privacy-framed
3. Setup             scene picker + consented sound list
4. Home              today's walk, ready when you are
5. Session   ★HERO   ambient → voice → trigger → pulse loop
6. After             pulse sparkline + three-option reflection
```

The last line is load-bearing. Make it true: no analytics that ping home without consent.

### 3. Setup

└─────────────────────────┘
```

Two distinct sections by design. Picking a scene is a *place* decision. Picking sounds is a *consent* decision. They must not blur.

### 4. Home

```
┌─────────────────────────┐

```

Note: "about six minutes" not "6:00". Duration is approximate, not a stopwatch — the journal tone rejects precision in non-pulse contexts.

└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Trigger-sound behavior:**

1. Ambient stays at full volume. No visual warning. No countdown.
2. Trigger sound plays at the user's current intensity setting.
3. Breathing circle does one barely-perceptible accent pulse.
4. Voice continues with a calmer script.
5. If pulse > threshold: voice softens further, breathing slows, trigger auto-attenuates below the user's set ceiling. No popup. No alert.

**Intensity control (the slider):**

- Always visible during the session, drag-to-adjust.
- Controls *trigger sound volume only* — ambient soundscape and voice are unaffected.
- The slider position is a **ceiling**, not a fixed level. Automatic pulse-driven response can still drop trigger volume below the user's setting, then return to the ceiling when the pulse normalizes. The two layers never fight: both can only make things softer.
- The level the user lands on at session end becomes the default starting ceiling next time. If a veteran spent today's motorcycle session near *softer*, the app does not assume they are ready for full volume tomorrow.
- No numeric labels, no percentages, no "level 3 of 5". The slider is felt, not read.
- Implementation note: the slider's gesture handler must interrupt any in-flight automatic attenuation animation cleanly. If the user grabs the slider mid-spike-response, the auto-animation must not overwrite their input. Use Reanimated shared values.

Three options, deliberately not a 1–5 scale and not good/bad. *Still here* goes first — it's the most honest option for someone who just got through something hard.

Sheet style: `bg-elev`, rounded, no scrim flash. Slides in from bottom at default 600ms ease-out. The phone number is the primary tappable — `tel:1201` URI.

## Bilingual & RTL

- Locale detected at launch via `expo-localization`. Hebrew device → Hebrew UI + RTL layout. Otherwise English.
- Fallback for non-EN/non-HE devices: **Hebrew** (the demo audience is Israeli).
- All copy in `lib/i18n.ts` with `en` and `he` keys.
- Layout mirroring via React Native's `I18nManager.forceRTL` + NativeWind `rtl:` variants. Every margin/arrow/alignment flips automatically.
- Wordmark is the one exception. It stays left-anchored in both layouts because it's a logo, not text.
