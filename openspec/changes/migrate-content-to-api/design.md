## Context

Content is scattered across three files with no single owner per scene, which produced the river-voice-on-every-scene bug. The backend doesn't exist yet, but `server/openapi.yaml` already defines the endpoints that will serve this content (`/scenes`, `/sounds`, `/voice-lines`, `/preferences`, `/sessions`, `/users/me`). The job here is to create the client seam those endpoints will plug into, fix the per-scene coherence now, and leave a greppable trail of what's still hard-coded.

Constraints: Expo SDK 54, Expo Go (so no native modules that need a custom dev build for the demo), offline-capable, bilingual.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- One typed module (`content.ts`) that owns all content access, shaped like the API responses.
- A scene is one coherent bundle; picking Park yields park imagery + park voice.
- Every hard-coded data site marked `TODO(api): <endpoint>` and greppable.
- Looping video on the active session; still image on the Setup picker.

**Non-Goals:**

- Building or calling the backend. No network code lands here.
- Producing the actual media files (team asset work) — only the integration and the `require()` wiring.
- Personalizing pulse thresholds or session length (separate future change).
- Removing the mock pulse generator (it stays until HealthKit lands).

## Decisions

### One adapter module, shaped like the API

`content.ts` exports functions that return the same types the API will return — `getScenes()`, `getSounds()`, `getVoiceScript(scene, phase, lang)`, `getDefaultPreferences()`. Today they read bundled local data; later their bodies become `fetch` calls. Types are shared with (or mirror) `server/openapi.yaml` component schemas.

**Alternative considered:** a React context/provider. Rejected for now — the data is static at the local stage, so plain functions are simpler. The provider can wrap `content.ts` later when data becomes async without changing call sites (the functions can return promises then).

### A scene is a bundle

```ts
type Scene = {
  key: SceneKey;
  label: { en: string; he: string };
  media: { still: ImageSource; video?: VideoSource };
  tint: { top: string };
  voice: Record<Phase, { en: string; he: string }>;
};
```

This is the fix for the mismatch: the voice script lives *inside* the scene, so it can't drift from the label. The generic `session.voice.*` i18n keys go away; voice text comes from the active scene.

### Video on session, still on picker

`expo-video` for the active session background — one muted, looping clip under the existing dark overlay. The Setup picker uses the `still` for each scene (four simultaneous videos would be wasteful and janky). Motion is kept slow and ambient; busy footage is activating.

**Alternative considered:** video thumbnails on the picker cards. Rejected for performance and because stills read fine at card size.

### TODO marker convention

`// TODO(api): GET /scenes — replace bundled data with backend fetch`. The `TODO(api)` tag is greppable (`grep -rn "TODO(api)"`), and each names the endpoint from `openapi.yaml`. This is the traceability artifact the proposal promises.

### What gets marked vs moved

- **Moved behind the seam:** scenes, sounds, voice scripts, default preferences.
- **Marked in place (not moved yet):** user name in `home.greeting` (→ `/users/me`), after-screen sparkline (→ from the session record), session timeline `SCRIPT` and pulse `TARGETS`/thresholds (→ session program config). These are marked because moving them is more invasive than this change wants to be, but they must be traceable.
- **Left as-is, documented:** `CRISIS_NUMBER = "1201"` — region config, not enriched content; stays hard-coded with a comment noting it's intentional.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Risk:** `expo-video` behavior in Expo Go on SDK 54 for looping background video. → **Mitigation:** the seam returns an optional `video`; if it's absent or fails, `SceneBackground` falls back to the `still`. The demo works either way.
- **Risk:** bundling four video loops inflates app size. → **Mitigation:** keep clips short (~6–10s seamless loops), compressed to ~1–2 MB; only the session loads video, lazily.
- **Trade-off:** marking-in-place (rather than moving) some data leaves partial inconsistency — some content is behind the seam, some is just commented. Accepted: moving everything at once is a bigger change than the demo timeline allows, and the markers keep it honest.

## Migration Plan

No data migration. When the backend exists, each `content.ts` function body swaps from local data to `fetch`, call sites are unchanged (or gain `await`). Rollback = revert; local data is still in the bundle.
